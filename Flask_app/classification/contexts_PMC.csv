After grafting PPDA onto the surface of the CDs, new peaks at around 2973 and 1652 cm −1  were observed, which correspond to C=C/C=N stretch of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [ 29 ].

The use of CNPs [ 22 , 23 , 24 ] for sensing purposes shows many interesting features, such as the high fluorescence quantum yield [ 25 ], water solubility, low toxicity [ 26 ], low-cost synthesis [ 27 ] and the possibility to functionalize their external shell [ 28 ].",Carbon-Dot-Based Dual-Emission Nanohybrid Produces a Ratiometric Fluorescent Sensor for In Vivo Imaging of Cellular Copper Ions,10.1002/anie.201109089

Additional file  1  (Figure S1-S4) shows some typical growth situations of the bean sprouts with time. In the initial stage (before 72 h), no obvious difference is observed among all the samples; however, nanoparticles with high concentration (≥800 μg/mL) show inhibitive effect on this plant after 96 h (Figure  3 a,b,c,d,e). Figure  3 e shows the detailed comparison of the averaged growth lengths ( n  = 60) in all groups, the length of bean sprouts generally decreases with increasing the concentration of nanomaterials, and it is clear to see that GQDs exhibit remarkable inhibition at high concentration and more dose-dependent than others. Except for GQDs, the other three can promote the growth of bean sprout at the concentration less than 800 μg/mL, demonstrating nontoxicity of these nanomaterials. But for the high concentration (1,200 μg/mL), all these nanoparticles show different degree of inhibition. It is worth noting that the length curve of SWCNTs changes more obviously over the 96 h due to its low solubility (compared to the other three carbon-based nanomaterials), and the final results (Figure  3 e) imply that SWCNTs display less dose-dependent and toxicity after a complete growth circle (120 h). Interestingly, it finds that 100 μg/mL seems to be the most conducive concentration for the growth of green gram sprouts. All these imply that the toxicity of these nanoparticles is time/dose-dependent. So dosage should be concerned in practice, especially particle with such small size can permeate throughout the cytoderm and cytomembrane with good biocompatibility [ 25 , 30 , 31 ]. As shown in Figure  4 , bean sprouts cultivated at high concentration of CQDs emit green fluorescence as marked by red circle when irradiated by a 365 nm UV beam in dark (Figure  4 d); however, no fluorescence was observed at low concentration. After drying at room temperature, bean sprouts still possess fluorescence (Figure  4 c).In addition, the impact of nanomaterials on environment also deserves our full attention. Although the initial concentration of nanoparticles presents irregular influence on pH mainly due to dispersibility of nanoparticles in water, the pH indeed changes with different degrees compared to control group over all the concentration (Figure  3 f), which would affect aquatic organism and even lead them to toxicosis.",Carbon-dot-based dual-emission nanohybrid produces a ratiometric fluorescent sensor for in vivo imaging of cellular copper ions,10.1002/anie.201109089

It is necessary to develop a fast, convenient, sensitive method for BPA detection. Among these methods, fluorescence analysis methods for BPA detection have received extensive attention due to their simple operation, high sensitivity, real-time measurement and low cost. 16  However, there are still some problems with these methods. For example, fluorescence sensors are easily affected by external factors, such as probe concentration and excitation intensity, 17  unobvious color change which is difficult to be observed with the naked eye, 18 etc.  These problems might be caused by the single emission spectrum of a fluorophore. 19  Thus, a dual-emission radiometric fluorescent sensor has been considered as a better choice. 20  This kind of fluorescent sensors is usually composed of dual-emitting fluorophores, which are used as reference units or response parts. 21  To solve the problem of weak fluorescent signals, new materials such as nanocomposites can be introduced to the sensors.",No title,10.1002/anie.201109089

In ratiometric fluorescent probes based on CQDs, there are two major strategies for constructing dual-emission ratiometric fluorescent probes. One is to apply the CQDs as a reference signal which does not respond to the analyte. The other is to introduce CQDs as response signals that are sensitive to analyte and respond to the analyte under optimal conditions 7 , 9 , 10 . In many literatures based on CQDs ratiometric fluorescent probes, the CQDs were used as either analyte-response 11 , 12  or reference unit 13 , 14 .

10.3390/nano11051232,B28-nanomaterials-11-01232,"Recently, dual-emission CDs based on ratiometric fluorescence have been used to develop novel methods for more accurate ion detection [ 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 ]. The mechanism depends on the fluorescent properties of the dual-emission CDs. The two different emission centers of these CDs show different levels of sensitivity to ions. The exact content of the detected ions can be calculated by establishing a proportional relationship between the fluorescence intensities of different emission centers. Due to the built-in correction of two distinct emission centers, this method can effectively reduce background interference. Some novel ratiometric CDs have been used as probes to detect different ions. Zhu et al. prepared dual-emission CDs centered at 485 and 644 nm [ 28 ]. The fluorescence peak of the CDs at 485 nm was gradually quenched by Cu 2+ , while that at 644 nm maintained its original intensity throughout. Thus, these CDs could be used as a ratiometric fluorescent sensor for Cu 2+  ions. Some ratiometric probes can be used to detect different ions simultaneously [ 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 ]. Wang et al. carbonized glutathione in a water/formamide mixture to prepare novel dual-emission CDs [ 33 ], which displayed two emissions at 470 and 655 nm. The CDs of the two ions did not interfere with each other; when Fe 3+  was added to the CD solutions, the emission center of the CDs at 655 nm displayed a clear quenching. Similarly, when Zn 2+  was added to the CD solutions, the emission center of the CDs at 470 nm displayed an obvious quenching effect.

CdTe QDs were selected since they can be facilely synthesized via aqueous synthetic routes with high fluorescent yield 30 . To achieve visual color profiling, red-emitting CdTe QDs (with six common thiols as capping ligands: three amino acid L-Cys, N-A-cys, GSH, and three carboxylic acid, TGA, MPA and MSA) were obtained with a one-step refluxing route 32 .

A well-resolved absorption maximum of the first electronic transition at 595 nm and a red PL emission band of 630 nm were identified for L-Cys capped CdTe QDs ( Figure S1A ). To supply a reference color that facilitates visual readout, green-emitting fluorescein was chosen for use, which exhibits a bright emission band at 530 nm. After mixing, the PL spectra of the CdTe QDs-fluorescein mixture retain the profile of both CdTe QDs and fluorescein ( Figure S1B ). Importantly, both CdTe QDs and fluorescein can be excited at 365 nm ( Figure S1B ), which paves the way of using a handheld UV lamp for convenient visual detection.

CQDs exhibit a discrete quasi-spherical geometric shape and particle sizes below 10 nm, which are reported to possess more intriguing characters and activities compared with other carbon nanomaterials. 1  This has consequently positioned carbon quantum dots as potential alternatives to the other members of the carbon nanostructures family. 2–4  It was reported that Xu  et al.  first investigated CQDs as fluorescent carbonaceous nanostructures during the electrophoretic purification of single walled carbon nanotubes. 5  Afterwards, numerous studies were extensively concerned with investigating various methods for the synthesis of CQDs and studying their outstanding and superior properties, such as chemical inertness, amazing luminescence, low cost, excellent biocompatibility, and abundance of raw materials. 6–12",No title,10.1002/anie.201109089

In the presence of Cu 2+ , the as-prepared N-CDs with strong fluorescence (curve a) were efficiently quenched (curve b), suggesting that an effective electron or energy transfer process have happened between Cu 2+  and N-CDs 49 ,  50 . This transfer process was mainly caused by the chelation of Cu 2+  with N-CDs, which could be ascribed to the quite high thermodynamics affinity of Cu 2+  for typical N,O-chelate ligands on the surface of the N-CDs and rapid metal-to-ligand binding kinetics 51 ,  52 . In order to investigate the driving force between Cu 2+  and CDs, Zeta potential measurement has been carried out. As shown in Supplementary Fig.  S6 , the Zeta potential of the N-CDs and copper ions is −27.85 ± 1.5 mV and 0.49 ± 0.5 mV, respectively. When Cu 2+  is added into the CDs solution, the Zeta potential becomes to be −13.88 ± 1.2 mV, suggesting that the driving force between CDs and Cu 2+  is electrostatic adsorption. Once PPi was added into the N-CDs/Cu 2+  solution, a clear recovery of the fluorescence (curve c) of N-CDs was observed because PPi preferentially bound to Cu 2+  with very high stability constant of PPi-Cu 2+  complex (stability constant log  K 
 PPi-Cu  = 12.45) 53 . After ALP was introduced into the system, PPi was hydrolyzed to Pi and the fluorescence of N-CDs was quenched again (curve d) as a result of the reintegration of N-CDs and the as-released Cu 2+ . The results indicate the great possibility of this N-CDs-based sensing platform for sensitive PPi and ALP detections.

All nano-sized fluorescent carbon materials with one dimension less than 10 nm can be classified as CDs, and these can be derived from various carbon materials such as fullerenes, graphite, carbon nanotubes, and graphene [ 4 – 6 ]. CDs have several advantages compared to other conventional fluorescent sensors. For example, organic dyes are inexpensive and effective as fluorescent probes, but they are easily photobleached. In contrast, CDs are much more resistant to photobleaching [ 7 – 9 ]. Additionally, semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are comparably as good as CDs in terms of photostability, quantum efficiency, and tunable fluorescence, but QDs cannot be used to trace a single molecule for long-term monitoring because of their intrinsic blinking [ 10 – 15 ]. Moreover, the main pitfall of QDs is their toxicity, which is due to their heavy metal content, including metals such as cadmium; this limits their biological and environmental applications [ 16 – 19 ]. Compared to other fluorescent raw materials, CDs are synthesized from inexpensive carbon sources that are abundant in nature and are, thus, bio-friendly. Furthermore, there are several simple methods to modify the surface state of CDs, which allow researchers to tune the solubility and quantum yields of CDs according to their experimental requirements [ 20 – 30 ].",Carbon-dot-based dual-emission nanohybrid produces a ratiometric fluorescent sensor for in vivo imaging of cellular copper ions,10.1002/anie.201109089

10.1038/srep03564,b13,"Firstly, among all the C-dots, the acidic amino acids derived C-dots had the largest size distribution, which could allow the existence of larger sp 2  conjugation of carbons in their cores. Both theoretical and experimental results have indicated that larger sp 2  conjugation of C atoms in another PL CNM, graphene quantum dots, can lead to emission at longer wavelength 1 . Similarly, the C-dots with larger sp 2  conjugation would emit longer wavelength showing yellow or orange color. Secondly, C-dots derived from basic amino acids had the smallest size distribution to emit at shorter wavelength, they emitted blue light. Although the size distributions of the neutral aliphatic and basic amino acids derived C-dots were similar, the former ones emitted green color. This should be due to the incorporation of higher content of N atoms in the basic amino acids-derived C-dots. As previously reported, doping of N atoms in CNMs usually induce PL blue shifted 41 . Finally, the unexpected intense blue emission of the aromatic amino acids-derived C-dots could attribute to the original sp 2  carbons in the starting materials.

[ 56 ] demonstrated a metal-coated nano-well array for ultrasensitive refractive index sensing fabricated by an inexpensive large-area nanoreplication technique. Mei and Tang [ 57 ] vertically aligned GNRs on a glass surface as a plasmonic substrate to detect a molecular beacon ( Figure 4 A). This dramatically enhanced the LSPR between adjacent GNRs compared to an ensemble of random GNRs. Inserting an intermediate spacer of appropriate thickness between the fluorophore and the surface of the GNR array resulted in plasmonic coupling enhancement of the fluorescence signal up to 30 nm away. Zhang et al. mass-fabricated Au nanohole arrays by nanoimprinting using a 4-inch nickel mold [ 58 ]. These Au nanohole arrays showed high fluorescence enhancement through simultaneous excitation of localized surface plasmon (LSP) and propagating surface plasmon (PSP) modes. Simultaneous excitation of LSP and PSP modes resulted in a detection limit of 140 fM for a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) biomarker. Dual mode detection offered a seven-fold better than when only LSP was resonantly excited on the same substrate. Miranda et al. developed a randomly arranged MEF-based immunosensor of AuNPs that was fabricated through a three-step process to regulate the optical properties of size, interparticle distance, and optimal gold nanostructures ( Figure 4 B). These AuNPs enhanced the fluorescence emission of three fluorescent dyes (Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 546, and PE Cy7) approximately 150-fold on a randomly arranged MEF immunosensor to achieve a detection limit of 28.67 pM (4.3 ng/mL) for immunoglobulin detection [ 59 ]. Kang’s group arranged 300 nm gold nanodisks using electron-beam lithography and used them as sensors for the high-sensitivity detection of biomolecules [ 60 ]. They designed the analyte to be sandwiched between a capture antibody immobilized on a gold nanodisk and a detection antibody conjugated with QDs. Using this, biogenic amines (histamine (His), tyramine (Tyr), and putrescine (Put)) and thyroid hormone markers (thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine (T3), and thyroxine (T4)) were quantified by multiple simultaneous analysis, showing aM and yM detection limits, respectively ( Figure 4 C) [ 61 , 62 ].

10.3390/molecules29174211,B45-molecules-29-04211,"Fluorescence sensing based on the fluorescent CD probe has attracted widespread attention for the detection of metal ions. Thus, we assessed the synthetic CDs as a sensor for different metal ions, including K + , Ag + , Ca 2+ , Co 2+ , Na + , Zn 2+ , Hg 2+ , Pb 2+ , Mn 2+ , Ba 2+ , Sr 2+ , Fe 2+ , Cu 2+ , Al 3+ , and Fe 3+ .  Figure 6 a displays the change in the fluorescence intensity of CDs after the addition of different metal ions. Surprisingly, the addition of copper ions resulted in a sharp decline in the intensity of fluorescent CDs, while other metal ions exhibited an inappreciable effect on fluorescence intensity. This phenomenon strongly confirms that synthetic CDs can selectively identify Cu 2+  and can serve as a “turn-off” fluorescent probe for monitoring Cu 2+ . In order to eliminate the interference of other cations, we carried out an interfering experiment and investigated the most common interfering cations, including K + , Ag + , Ca 2+ , Co 2+ , Na + , Zn 2+ , Hg 2+ , Pb 2+ , Mn 2+ , Ba 2+ , Sr 2+ , Fe 2+ , Al 3+ , and Fe 3+ . This has validated that the addition of interfering cations did not induce any significant influence on the detection of Cu 2+ . Furthermore, to determine the impact of concentrations on fluorescence intensity, Cu 2+  ions ranging from 10 μM to 100 μM were added to the CDs and the fluorescence was recorded ( Figure 6 b). With the increase in the concentration of copper ions, the fluorescence intensity of CDs reduced gradually. To examine the sensitivity of CDs to the concentrations of Cu 2+ , the fluorescence quenching efficiency was probed through the Stern–Volmer of  F 0 /F  = 1 +  K SV  [ C ] plot (R 2  = 0.9965) in the concentration range of 0.1–9 μM ( Figure 6 c), where  F 0  and  F  are the intensities of fluorescent CDs before and after the addition of Cu 2+  ions, [ C ] depicts the concentration of Cu 2+ , and the quenching constant  K SV  is calculated to be 0.063, which is the slope of the fitting line. Meanwhile, the limit of detection (LOD) of Cu 2+  was measured to be 1.38 μM based on the formula mentioned in  Section 3.7 . This result is much lower than those of previous reports listed in  Table 1 , indicating that the proposed Cu 2+  probe is more sensitive. Compared with previous reports, this presented method is simple, sensitive, selective, and enables the label-free sensing of Cu 2+ . Synthetic CDs can be implemented as a highly sensitive fluorescent sensor to quantitatively monitor Cu 2+ . In terms of the Cu 2+  detection mechanism of CDs, firstly, Cu 2+  exhibits the highest absorption affinity to the carbon nanostructure compared to other transition metals. This is the prerequisite for the effective fluorescence quenching in the CDs/Cu 2+  system [ 44 ]. Secondly, it should be attributed to the electron transfer from excited CDs to the unfilled orbital of Cu 2+ , which further leads to strong non-radiative electron/hole recombination, resulting in aggregation-induced emission quenching (AIE) in CDs-Cu 2+  [ 45 ]. Thirdly, due to the excellent oxidizing properties of Cu 2+ , this makes copper ions the most adequate receptors for the transferred electron from CDs [ 46 ].",Carbon-dot-based dual-emission nanohybrid produces a ratiometric fluorescent sensor for in vivo imaging of cellular copper ions,10.1002/anie.201109089

In comparison to the pure N-CDs, there is a large increase and red-shift of the C–N band from 1266 cm −1  to 1214 cm −1  after adding Cu 2+ . This could be assigned to the binding affinity of N to Cu 2+  that weakens the C–N bond and thus vibrates at a lower energy. 61  In addition, the increase in the peak intensity at 725 cm −1  may be ascribed to the coordinate bond formation between the hydrogen atom of the methyl groups and the copper center. In detail, the strong hydrogen bonds between water molecules and carboxylate groups and the anagostic interactions between C–H⋯Cu is clear evidence of the formation of the intramolecular complex. 62,63  Furthermore, the stretching vibrations of C O, C–O and C–O–C at 1641, 1045 and 1016 cm −1 , respectively, were significantly affected after Cu 2+  addition. This could be due to the coordinate bond formation between Cu 2+  and the active sites around N-CDs. It is believed that O atoms can donate a lone pair of electrons to the Cu 2+ , forming a coordinate covalent bond between Cu 2+  and O owing to the high oxidability of copper. 64–67  Considering the above results, the proposed Cu( ii ) adsorption by N-CDs was illustrated in  Fig. 6d , in which a N-CDs-Cu 2+  complex was formed due to the electrostatic interaction between Cu( ii ) and the –COO − , –OH and –N functional sites on the surface of N-CDs.",Carbon-Dot-Based Dual-Emission Nanohybrid Produces a Ratiometric Fluorescent Sensor for In Vivo Imaging of Cellular Copper Ions,10.1002/anie.201109089

The functionalization of the CNPs with AE-TPEA led to blue fluorescence (485 nm), while the CdSe/ZnS CNPs showed red fluorescence (644 nm). In the presence of Cu 2+  ions, the receptor site recognized these ions, and thus quenching of the blue fluorescence was observed, while the red fluorescence of the CdSe/ZnS CNPs remained unaltered. A linear response was observed under 50 mM and the calculated limit of detection was 1 mM, with good selectivity in the presence of other metal ions and amino acids.",No title,10.1002/anie.201109089
10.1371/journal.pone.0230646,pone.0230646.ref032,"There are several laboratory-based methods being carried out for the detection of the pesticides such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), capillary electrophoresis (CE), and mass spectrometry [ 15 ]. Although the mentioned methods are sensitive and display accurate results, significant number of such methods are laboratory-based, time consuming, and inapplicable for point-of-care detection [ 16 ]. Therefore, a simple, sensitive, and cost-effective method  w as designed for detecting pesticides, which is based on optical property. Optical based analytical probes provide a good condition of analysis since they often involve low cost reagents, simple instruments, short response time, and effortless to perform. A wide range of fluorescent-based sensors have been designed including organic dyes, quantum dots, metal-organic frameworks, fluorescent proteins, etc. Carbon dots (CDs) which have been discovered in 2004 during separation and purification process of single walled carbon nanotubes, have considered as promising in the last decade due to their outstanding optical properties, biocompatibility, negligible toxicity, great solubility, and facile synthesis. CDs are typically semi-spherical including amorphous to nanocrystalline, naturally consist of oxygen-nitrogen-based groups, and post-modified functional groups which cause easy interaction and binding to target molecules. CDs could be derived either from natural or non-toxic precursors which are inexpensive and appropriate for large scale applications [ 17 ]. The convenience of synthesis and unique properties of CDs have led to enormous attention for employing different kinds of precursors and synthesis methods, which were mainly classified as top-down and bottom-up approaches [ 18 – 21 ]. The “top-down” approach includes techniques such as arc-discharge [ 22 ], laser ablation [ 23 ], and electrochemical exfoliation [ 24 ]. As the “bottom-up” method contains microwave treatment [ 25 ], sonochemical treatment [ 26 ], thermal decomposition [ 27 ], and thermal treatment [ 28 ]. Among the above-mentioned methods, hydrothermal treatment is one of the most prevalent bottom-up method being used to synthesize CDs form peels or juices of fruits, known as green carbon sources. Hydrothermal carbonization provides simple one-step experimental setup through high temperature and pressure which avoids the need of highly toxic chemicals. Furthermore, a cost effective and sustainable source of raw and biowaste materials should be utilized for the synthesize of CDs [ 29 ]. Additionally, efforts to synthesize fluorescence emitting CDs have been made to use in sensors [ 30 ]. Carbon dots-based sensors have enormously been used for metallic ions detection such as Hg 2+  [ 31 ], Cu 2+  [ 32 ], K +  [ 33 ], Ag +  [ 34 ], and Fe 3+  [ 35 ]. Therefore, sensors could be used for the detection of a vast number of biological agents and materials. One of CDs green precursor is cauliflower ( Brassica Oleracea ) from the  Brassicaceae  family (syn.  Cruciferae ) which contains many organic compounds such as gallic, pyrogallol, catechin, protocatechuic, chlorogenic acid, rosemary acid, rutin, caffeic acid, vanillic acid, quercetin, naringenin, syringic acid, coumaric acid, cinnamic acid, and kaempferol [ 36 ]. These particular bioactive compounds could bring the right and crucial elements to synthesize carbon dots.",Carbon-dot-based dual-emission nanohybrid produces a ratiometric fluorescent sensor for in vivo imaging of cellular copper ions,No DOI
10.1021/acsomega.3c07612,ref202,"Wang et al. reported the synthesis of boron-doped CDs
through a hydrothermal method using ascorbic acid and boric acid as
precursors. The as-prepared CDs have an irregular shape with a particle
diameter of 10 nm and exhibit strong fluorescence. Since the formation
of nonfluorescent metal complexes between chelating oxygen atoms on
the surface of the CDs, fluorescence is quenched by Cu(II) and Pb(II)
ions. A sensitive B-CDs-based FL analytical system for Cu 2+  and Pb 2+  ions was designed by taking advantage of the
efficient FL quenching effect of Cu 2+  and Pb 2+  ions caused by charge transfer between −COO/OH groups or
bidentate OH-donors and Cu 2+  or Pb 2+  ions, respectively.
It is significant to note that the quenched Cu (II)-quenched B-CDs
complexes system exhibits very sensitive and selective detection of
PPi by a FL recovery procedure, whereas Pb(II)-quenched B–C-dots
enable recovery selective detection of Pb 2+  and Cu 2+  ions. A detection range of 8.47–13.56 nM was achieved
through this fluorescent probe. 199  Dong
et al. developed a novel sensing method for the detection of Cu 2+  ions based on the quenched fluorescence (FL) signal of branched
poly(ethylenimine) (BPEI)-functionalized carbon quantum dots (CQDs).
It was observed that the polyamine-functionalized CQDs were efficient
FL probes for detecting Cu 2+  ( Figure  7 a). The amino groups on the surface of the
BPEI-CQDs can interact with Cu 2+  ions to form an absorbent
complex, which then causes the FL of the CQDs to be sensitively quenched
by means of an inner filter effect. With a detection limit as low
as 6 nM and a dynamic range of 10 to 1100 nM, this simple approach
can provide a quick, reliable, and selective detection of Cu 2+ . The FL-based sensing system based on CQDs has been found to have
promising applications in the detection of Cu 2+  in environmental
water samples and exhibits several benefits including quick detection,
high sensitivity, good selectivity, wide linear response range, and
low cost. 200  Sun et al. reported the fabrication
of a novel, highly fluorescent Cu 2+  sensing probe using
hydrothermal treatment of graphene quantum dots (GQDs). The greenish-yellow
fluorescent GQDs (gGQDs) with a low quantum yield (QY, 2.5%) are changed
into amino-functionalized GQDs (afGQDs) with a high QY (16.4%) after
hydrothermal treatment in ammonia. The selectivity of afGQDs for Cu 2+  is substantially higher than that of gGQDs because the Cu 2+  ion has a higher binding affinity and faster chelating kinetics
with N and O on the surface than other transition metal ions. Importantly,
amination transformed the GQDs’ surface charge from negative
to positive, thereby making it easier for cells to absorb the of GQDs.
In order to detect Cu 2+  in aqueous solutions and even in
live cells, a simple fluorescence sensor can be fabricated by utilizing
the aforementioned features having a limit of detection of 6.9 nM 201  ( Figure  7 b).  N -(2-Aminoethyl)- N , N , N ′-tris(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)ethane-1,2-diamine
(AE-TPEA), an organic molecule specific for Cu 2+  ions,
was integrated by Zhu et al. into a hybrid system made of carbon and
CdsSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs), leading to the development of a selective
and sensitive ratiometric strategy for intracellular sensing of Cu 2+  ions. As a dual-emission fluorophore (CdsSe/C nanohybrid),
the CQDs emitting blue fluorescence are hybridized with the CdsSe/ZnS
QDs emitting red fluorescence ( Figure  7 c). The CdSe/ZnS QDs embedded in silica shells (CdSe/SiO 2 ) are inert to Cu 2+  ions and only serve as reference
signals for a built-in correction to avoid environmental effects.
In the meanwhile, inorganic–organic CdSe/C-TPEA probes are
developed by conjugating the specific Cu 2+  ion receptor
AE-TPEA with the responsive CdSe/C nanohybrid. When excited at a single
wavelength of 400 nm, the hybrid probe exhibits two emission bands
with respective centered at 485 and 644 nm. While the fluorescence
of the red CdSe/SiO 2  particles does not change, that of
the blue CQDs functionalized with AE-TPEA selectively recognizes Cu 2+  ions. As a ratiometric fluorescent sensor for Cu 2+  ions, it results as a consequence of the constant color changes
caused by the addition of Cu 2+  ions, which are visible
with the naked eye under a UV light when the two fluorescence intensities
are varied. 202","Carbon-Dot-Based Dual-Emission Nanohybrid

10.1038/s41467-024-47549-1,CR20,"In the past several decades, many methods have been widely used to detect either Cu 2+  or Cu + , such as atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) 11 , mass spectrometry (MS) 12 , fluorescent methods 13 – 15 , and electrochemical methods 16 . We have designed and developed several ratiometric fluorescent and electrochemical sensors to monitor and accurately quantify either Cu 2+  or Cu +  in the live brain or living cells with high selectivity 17 – 20 . However, simultaneous quantitative analysis of Cu +  and Cu 2+  is quite difficult. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) offers highly sensitive molecular fingerprint information, as well as resistance to autofluorescence and photobleaching 21 , 22 . Recently, an SERS probe was developed by our group for simultaneous sensing of extracellular Cu +  and Cu 2+  in mouse cerebral cortex, and three routes were proposed for explaining the mechanisms of Cu +  and Cu 2+  increases during ischemia 23 . However, whether the increase in extracellular copper ions originated from inside the live cells remains unclear. More importantly, the contributions of Cu +  and Cu 2+  to cell death in processes related to Cu accumulation, such as ischemia and cuproptosis 24 – 27 , has not yet been elucidated, due to the lack of powerful tools for sensing and quantitative analysis of Cu +  and Cu 2+  simultaneously, especially in mitochondria. To draw a clear picture of the mechanisms of copper accumulation-related processes, the development of an effective probe for simultaneous analysis of mitochondrial Cu +  and Cu 2+  was needed, particularly in mitochondria. However, SERS probes assembled based on Au-S bonds are easily susceptible to unpredictable aggregation in cells 28 – 30 . In addition, the SERS response signal below 1100 cm −1  could be easily affected by native species in the complex cellular environment 31 , 32 . It is therefore desirable to develop a single SERS probe for real-time imaging and accuracy qualifying of intracellular Cu +  and Cu 2+  simultaneously, especially in mitochondria.",Carbon-dot-based dual-emission nanohybrid produces a ratiometric fluorescent sensor for in vivo imaging of cellular copper ions,10.1002/anie.201109089
10.3390/nano12060898,B118-nanomaterials-12-00898,"Fe-CDs were prepared by Zhao et al., from ammonium iron (III) citrate and urea as precursors. via hydrothermal reaction at 180 °C for six hours in stainless steel autoclave [ 114 , 115 , 116 , 117 , 118 , 119 ]. The products were then cooled to room temperature and neutralized to pH 7.0. The Fe-CDs proved to be promising dual-mode fluorometric and colorimetric nanosensors for Fe 3+  detection [ 113 ].  Figure 7 e,f show that the blue photoluminescence of Fe-CDs was quenched upon addition of Fe 3+  ions and the absorption band at 335 nm was increased [ 113 ]. The authors suggest that the actual coordination exchanges between Fe 3+  and the organic functional groups on the surface of the Fe-CDs contribute to the formation of the conjugate structure. According to He et al., Fe-CDs-Au Nano crystals (NCs) nanoprobes were prepared for ratiometric fluorescence detection of Zn 2+  at two emission wavelengths (445 nm and 650 nm) [ 113 ]. It was found that the red fluorescence of the Au nanocrystals increased with increasing Zn 2+  concentration, whereas the blue fluorescence of the Fe-CDs nanoparticles was independent [ 113 ]. This has been ascribed to the AIE enhancement of the Au nanocrystals.

10.3390/nano12060898,B118-nanomaterials-12-00898,"Doped CDs can be used in biological sensing due to their excellent electronic and electrochemical properties. Doped or hybrid CDs are utilized for photoluminescence, electrochemiluminescence and electrochemical sensors [ 114 ]. Benefitting from the turn-off of the photoluminescence properties of CDs, biological ions, biomolecules (sugar, antibodies, other sugars, amino acid) and proteins can be detected [ 115 , 116 , 117 ]. Cu 2+  and Fe 3+  ions play a crucial role in detection of diseases [ 118 , 119 ]. Hence, CDs can be used for detecting such ions which are co-factors for specific diseases. To detect a particular gene classification, even enzymatic reactions cannot be used. Since DNA has a highly specific nucleotide sequence, the principle of complementation is the only viable solution [ 51 ]. A combination of novel CDs and DNA probe for biosensor activity has been received wide-ranging interest in recent years due to their better functionalized properties of CDs and their superior affinity towards DNA, either by assembling or electrostatic charges interaction. Using the principle of DNA complementation, CDs coated with DNA were probed and placed on an Au nanoelectrode to create a DNA biosensor [ 120 ]. Nucleic acid biosensors often use the “on-off-on” strategy, just like other types of biosensors. In the case of DNA hybridization between two DNAs (single-stranded), the binding force is considerable greater than that of a single strand DNA with a quencher [ 120 ]. This is caused by the unique matching structures of DNA strands. Since the DNA strand has a strong tendency to complicate with the quencher, even the already-quenched CDs PL can be recovered in the occurrence of the DNA target strand ( Figure 8 a) [ 51 ]. In a hybrid CD-based optical biosensor, the degree of fluorescence reduction is used to detect target analytes. As an example, Shen et al. [ 115 ] designed a glucose biosensor based on phenyl-boronic acid-derived CDs particles. The surface boric acid of the CD interacts with glucose, allowing FRET energy transfer between the CD and glucose, effectively quenching the CD’s fluorescence ( Figure 8 b) [ 51 ]. As a result of the degree of fluorescence quenching, the body’s glucose levels are assessed, achieving a 10–250 times higher sensitivity than the previous boric acid fluorescent nano-sensing exposure system [ 51 ].",Carbon-Dot-Based Dual-Emission Nanohybrid Produces a Ratiometric Fluorescent Sensor for In Vivo Imaging of Cellular Copper Ions,10.1002/anie.201109089
10.3390/nano12060898,B118-nanomaterials-12-00898,"Bioimaging uses organic and inorganic fluorophores, which induce weak fluorescence and thus require binding with antibody molecules for cellular uptake. [ 126 ]. Metal-doped CDs, due to their exceptional optical properties, tissue compatibility and efficient cellular uptake, are gaining popularity as a substitute to organic/inorganic fluorophores [ 126 ]. The biological applications of metal-doped CDs show promising results when formulated by the sonochemical method. This is due to their high biocompatibility whereas cytotoxicity can be induced during chemical preparation via the use of toxic chemicals and adverse conditions [ 78 ]. Metal-doped CDs were used as fluorescent tags for cell imaging by Sun et al., [ 127 ]. Furthermore, metals-doped CDs (Ga, Ag, Au, Sn, and Zn) have been widely used to image intracellular diverse cells, such as HeLa cells, HepG2 cells line, and neuronal cells line such as PC12 and SH-SY5Y ( Figure 9 ) [ 12 ]. The optical properties [ 128 ] of doped CDs were also used for real-time molecules stalking in living cells, due to their superior photostability, biocompatibility and bright fluorescence [ 128 ]. Zheng et al., used the CDs to conjugate with protein for real-time monitoring [ 129 ]. When imaging fluorescent probes in vivo, long wavelengths are crucial, and they must be transparent to biological tissues in comparison to cell imaging and cellular uptake. Due to their multicolor fluorescence properties, hybrid or doped CDs are a good choice for in vivo imaging.

10.1016/j.bioactmat.2023.10.025,bib155,"Metal ions are an indispensable element for numerous biological processes and their regulation is essential to maintain normal functions of living organisms through a variety of physiological processes [ 153 ]. The metal ion imbalance in cells and tissues can lead to various diseases, and thus it is crucial to screen the content of metal ions [ 154 , 155 ]. There are different ways to detect metal ions. For example, Choi et al. [ 156 ] detected the concentration of Cu 2+  based on plasmonic resonance energy transfer-based nanoscale spectroscopy, and Bar-shir et al. [ 157 ] performed the specific magnetic resonance imaging of Ca 2+  by coupling ion chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) to the broad range of chemical shifts in 19F NMR spectroscopy. Nevertheless, because the complex environment makes the traditional method less sensitive and unable to accurately predict the diseases, it is not easy to detect the metal ions in living organisms. Coordination of metals to unmodified DNA strands provides a new opportunity for the construction of new-type of probes for estimating the metal ion level that is used to evaluate the health of living organisms [ 158 ]. DNA strands have been demonstrated to be competent to design the sensing systems for the specific detection of metal ions [ 159 , 160 ]. For instance, by assembling DNA tetrahedron from a series of metal ion specific sequences, Qu et al. [ 161 ] developed the three-dimensional DNA nanostructure-encoded microchannels with spatial resolution ( Fig. 10 A) for the sensitive and selective detection of multiple heavy-metal ions. The channel used a DNA tetrahedral structure as a detection sensor, and adopted a bubble mediated shuttle reaction to improve the detection speed and efficiency. Three metal ions, Hg 2+ , Ag +  and Pb 2+ , were detected simultaneously (or individually) by this system, and the detection limits were 10 nM, 10 nM and 20 nM, respectively. Similarly, utilizing on the stable thymine-Hg 2+ -thymine complex, Yin’s group [ 162 ] established a DNA tetrahedron-based electrochemical sensor for the specific detection of mercury ions ( Fig. 10 B). Compared with the linear DNA-based detection of metal ions, DNA tetrahedral structure could be used to anchor onto the electrode surface in an orderly and directional manner, and the passivation process of the electrode was avoided. The detection limit of 100 pM was achieved. It can be envisioned that, with the help of coordination interaction between DNA bases and metal ions, DNA tetrahedron based sensing strategy is promising for metal ion detection within cells and in living organisms. Interestingly, for now, because metal ions often serve as the cofactors of DNAzymes, specifically-designed DNAzyme probes are more commonly involved for the detection and quantification of metal ions within living cells than DNA framework nanostructures [ [163] ,  [164] ,  [165] ,  [166] ,  [167] ,  [168] ,  [169] ]. It is interesting to note that DNA tetrahedral nanostructure can enhance the stability of DNAzyme probes against enzymatic degradation in intracellular medium. For example, by combining two DNAzymes with DNA tetrahedrons, Xiang's group proposed a dual-color encoded DNAzyme nanoprobe for the multiplexed sensing of UO 2 2+  and Pb 2+  in living cells [ 170 ]. The tetrahedron-based nanoprobes could stably exist in cell lysates over 24 h. Fig. 10 DNA tetrahedron-based biosensors for the detection of metal ions and viruses.

10.1016/j.bioactmat.2023.10.025,bib155,"Cantilever-mediated orientation refers to the attachment of functional molecules or moieties to the edge arms of DNA tetrahedron [ 388 , 399 , 400 ]. Considerable number of researchers used cantilever orientation technology to install the specific molecules onto DNA tetrahedron, achieving unique features, such as the resistance to enzymatic degradation [ 33 ] and collective effect of DNA nanoframework and functional molecules [ 113 , 147 ]. Moreover, cantilever-mediated orientation enabled better the control over the spatial position and density of functional moieties [ 59 ], achieving synergistic effect between several functional moieties at different positions. Therefore, Jiang et al. [ 35 ] constructed multi-cantilever DNA tetrahedral nanostructure for dual-modality imaging of tumor based on near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) ( Fig. 19 A). The folic acid, NIR emitter DyLight 755, and radioactive isotope  99m TC were precisely decorated onto the cantilever or vertex. The folic acid endowed nanostructure with tumor-targeting ability, while NIR 755 and  99m TC were used to perform NIR optical and SPECT imaging effects, respectively. This method realized noninvasive and accurate tumor imaging in mouse model. Tian et al. [ 401 ] designed a DNA nano-framework probe for the targeted imaging of brain tumors based on cantilever-mediated orientation of functional moieties onto DNA tetrahedron ( Fig. 19 B). Specifically, Angiopep-2 (ANG) and near-infrared DyLight 755 groups were separately positioned onto DNA tetrahedron in a cantilever-mediated manner. The resulting ANG-modified probe exhibited a lengthened incubation time, while ANG functionalization made DNA tetrahedron cross the BBB and accurately targeted U87MG human malignant glioma, and DyLight 755 was used for fluorescence imaging. The experimental results proved that the cantilever-mediated modification of DNA tetrahedron effectively controlled the spatial position of each functional group and accurately regulated the space and stoichiometry. Moreover, the cantilever-mediated orientation strategy was also suitable for the location of therapeutic molecules and targeting ligand for precisely-targeted delivery for the cancer therapy [ 402 ].
